Robo-Speaker 1.0

Description:
Robo-Speaker 1.0 is a Python project created by Rudy using the win32com.client library. It allows users to convert text input into speech using the SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface) technology on Windows systems. The program welcomes users with a personalized greeting and prompts them to enter text that the system then vocalizes using a synthesized voice. Users can interrupt the speech with breaks implemented via sleep calls. Additionally, the program includes a command to turn off the speaker, providing a seamless user experience.

Key Features:

Speech synthesis using win32com.client and SAPI.
User-friendly text-to-speech interface with interactive input.
Pause functionality using sleep calls for improved user control.
Usage Instructions:

Run the script in a Python environment on a Windows machine.
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter text for speech synthesis.
Type 'turn off speaker' to exit the program.
Technologies Used:
Python, win32com.client, SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface)

Future Enhancements:

Implement voice customization options.
Integrate with external APIs for multilingual support.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
